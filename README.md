## 🌿 About the Game

**Anglocita Semesta: Restore the Nature** is a **2D Platformer & Adventure** game centered on **healing the environment rather than dominating it**.  
Players control a child exploring a post-ecological-collapse world, where nature exists as a wounded, living entity that must be restored through mindful interaction with the environment.

The game emphasizes **environmental storytelling**, **permanent world changes**, and **silence as a space for reflection**, avoiding combat and complex systems.
